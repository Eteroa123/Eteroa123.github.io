<h2>
    Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,the decision you 
    made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
    
<p><table>           
    A situation where I had to make a ethical decision was at my time and software company called Vent , where I was a Software Engineer Intern for 3 months.
    A decision that I had to make was “Whether I let people talk to me and treat me like this” or “Carry on and be walked over by people”.
    I weight in the my values and knew my mum did not raise a fool but a  girl who is here to tell them what up. So what I did was that I spoke up. To
    Not treating me like that even if I am a intern.Manage me for my growth no for a time period. To understand that people are humans not machines.

    From this I spoke up as a new entry graduate just wanting to learn. I spoke because  I  didn’t want to another intern to go through what I went through.
    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
    My cultural has influenced me in my values because it has lead me to take the   experience that I went through and not stay quite. To be able to voice out my experience to not ruin a company but to give feedback . Because of my actions there has been a restructure into the internship program. 
    Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.

    <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
</h2>

<p><table>
    For my limitations I was able to make a choice where I placed my pride and shame and to come back and study to sharpen up my skills in order for me to have the right tools for me .
    For my strength I really haven't made choices like those yet but interested in how to deal with these in the future. 
</p><table>
<h2>
    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.

<p><table>
    My culture has influenced me a lot in this decision there have been clashes because there are experiences where I struggled but yeah there have been a major influence in my journey in my choices. 
</p><table>   

    <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development<h2>

<p><table>
    They are average my limitations for me would weigh more than my strength because I focus more on them. But I believe that there is more room for improvement. 
    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
    My ability to ask for help when I’m stuck and to stay determined when things get tough. These will help me towards me problem solving and figuring out obstacles on my way. 
</p><table>
<h2>
    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
</h2>
<p><table>   
    The same situation mentioned earlier at Vend.  Let just say the work done there has come to a end and the most I got out of it was a lesson learned. And a whole new look into tech.
