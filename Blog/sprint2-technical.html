<h2> What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h2>

<!--This shows the drop down information for each meaning-->

<button class="QuestionInfo"><h2>Margin</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Margin is know as the space that is outside something. So picture a drawn box and picture 
  three boxes inside this box. Margin is the outer box. When adding in margin you are given
access to make the margin wider and longer. </p>

</div>

<button class="QuestionInfo"><h2>Border</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The border  goes around the padding and element box. If we can picture again the drawn box then we can
  picture the border inside the margin box. Borders are important not just because its to make it look pretty. But you can 
change the spacing and also the width of the border.  </p>

</div>

<button class="QuestionInfo"><h2>Padding</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The padding goes inside the margin and border areas, and outside the content area. So that is what and where the padding is. And
  with padding you are able to remove space. For example I added table and I wanted to move it up. By playing around with the
Padding I was able to make it look tight and close. </p>
