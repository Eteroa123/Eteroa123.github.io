<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

<h3>The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. This was definition that was brought by the EDA.</h3>
<h4>There are also three steps towards “Emotional Intelligence”.</h4>
<p>1. Attention training</p>
<p>2. Self knowledge and Mastery</p>
<p>3. Creating Useful Mental Habits</p>

<h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
<p>IQ is a number that is obtained from a standardized test to represented an individual's ability of reasoning. What IQ measures is basically general intelligence.  
    What it really ensures is not success in life but in school. This makes it different than EQ because what you can gain from the EQ is success in life as it helps people to understand people. </p>

<h3>Why is it important?	</h3>
<p>This is important because if we can identity the difference between these two it can give us understanding.
 Because IQ is important but not everything in life isn’t about getting good grades but to have EQ is important because measuring someone based on a test in less important then have a EQ. Where the EQ can help you to understand emotion and feeling.
