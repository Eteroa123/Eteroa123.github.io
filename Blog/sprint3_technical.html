<h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS?</h2>
<p>
An analogy to describe the differnce between HTML and CSS is that the HTML 
is think of HTML as a canvas that can have anything on the canvas. And think 
of CSS as the paint that is about to paint a picture on the CSS.

<h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life..</h2>
<p>
<h3>Control Flow</h3>
<p>Control flow in a example of a everydays ssituation would be a process of straighting my hair.
        For example I would need to....</p>
<p>1. Wash my hair.</p>
<p>2. Dry my hair.</p>
<p> 3. Heat protection gel</p>
<p> 4. Straighten </p>
<p> 5. Complete.</p>
<p>This shows a process and also a particular way this is done. This is the same for control flow. There is
        particular way that scripts are written with fuctions and obnjects that make can be controled in a way 
        known as "Control Flow".</p>
</p>
<h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
<p>
    <h3>D.O.M</h3>
    <p>
            D.O.M stand for "Document object model". D.O.M is when the HTML , CSS and javascript come
            together as one. This whole flow is what the D.O.M stands for. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of how we interact with D.O.M is what we do everyday on a computer. And 
        that would be through the the window browser. How this connects is that when 
        you are on the window the process goes to the document ,HTML andit divided to 
        two sub headers which is either a the head and body.
    </p>

<h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>

<p>
    The difference between accessing data from array and from objects are that an array can hold 
    more than one value in the at a time.  An arry can hold many values unders a single name. And 
    you can access them by referring them to a index number. Arrays are also objects as well through 
    a operator called <i>typeof</i> where it returns object for arrays.
</p>
<p>
    A object is the same as any object  in our everday lives like a car , bike etc.
    But in javascript objects can be variables as well. To access an object you can 
    <p>1. <i>objectName.propertyName</i></p>
    <p>2.<i>objectName.["propertyName"]</i></p>
</p>
<h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
<p>
    A function is known a blocks of code that is used to desgined to carry out 
    a partiicular task. 
    So it pretty much is excuted when <i>"something"</i> calls it.
    Functions are real useful as functions are speacial type object.
    When declaring a function it actually same for calling an object.
